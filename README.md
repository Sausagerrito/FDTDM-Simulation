By default this app runs at 60fps, with N = 100,000.

If ran from the .exe it will open into your terminals default location. It is better to openn the terminal and scale it before you run the app. Running the app from the terminal also allows you to pass it arguments.

It can be run with the following arguments:
--m (enables multithreading for performance analysis, SLOWER)
--bench (disables graph rendering to benchmark the underlying computational performance)
